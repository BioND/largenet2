It provides data structures\r\nfor an in-memory representation of _directed or undirected_ networks, in which every\r\nnode and link can have an integer-valued state.\r\n\r\nEfficient access to (random) nodes and links as well as (random) nodes and links\r\nwith a given state value is provided. A limited number of graph-theoretical measures\r\nis implemented, such as the (state-resolved) in- and out-degree distributions and the\r\ndegree correlations (same-node and nearest-neighbor).\r\n\r\nThe `largenet2` library has been developed by [Gerd Zschaler](http://rincedd.github.com).\r\n\r\n[1]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2007.1229 \"T.
